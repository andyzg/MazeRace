MazeRace
========
A Java game made for practice. Currently implementing a maze generating algorithm involving depth first search. 

To get a maze generated, run the MazeRace.java program. Features to be implemented soon include moving around the maze with a fog of war.

Not extremely efficient in terms of memory space and speed but will soon be improved
